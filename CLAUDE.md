# Project: coop

## Overview

The `coop` project is a low level library for cooperative multitasking in C++. It prioritizes:
* High performance that trusts developers to know what they are doing
* Opinionated abstractions
* Safety, but not at the expense of performance of the above

## Code Organization
```

coop/       - Source files (.cpp)
build/      - Build artifacts (git-ignored)
```

## Coding Standards

### Style
- 4-space indentation, no tabs
- Max line length: 100 characters, but sanity prevails
- `PascalCase` is used for classes, methods
- Member variables are prefixed with `m_`
- `NULL` should never be used, use `nullptr` instead
- Comments should be used liberally to document wider intent and goals, but code should speak for itself
- Multiline comments should be avoided. Comment blocks should have a trailing, empty `//` line to
  improve visual separation

### Best Practices
- Patterns that stack allocate, or enable stack allocation, are preferred
- RAII should be used wherever possible
- Thread locals are explicitly disallowed outside of `::coop::Cooperator__thread_cooperator`
- stdint types (`int64_t`, `uint8_t`) are encouraged over `int`, `unsigned char` where possible/
  appropriate
- All I/O calls should be implemented through the coop::io patterns. Syscalls likely should as well.
- Use separate `build/release` and `build/debug` directories for release and debug mode builds
  respectively

### Error Handling
- Errors should bubble up using a checked-return pattern

## Architecture Notes

The library revolves around `Cooperator` and `Context` instances. The latter provide the stacks
which code runs on, and the former handles cooperating between them. The most fundamental building
block that ties these together is the `Coordinator`, which functions as a mutex facsimile and allows
one `Context` to block on action by another.

All actual "blocking" operations are forbidden, ideally including syscalls which should be dispatched
via the `coop::io` system which is built on top of `io_uring`.
