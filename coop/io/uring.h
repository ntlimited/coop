    // feeling out as to how it works; in short, we have a "best effort" system where if we have
    // space in our (statically allocated) array of registered fds, we just use it. Descriptors
    // get added automatically to the registered set if there is space, but because this is
    // (1) a syscall and (2) batchable, we defer it. This is done by tracking "dirty" and "clean"
    // generation markers: when a new descriptor is 'registered', we set `m_generation` to
    // the dirty generation on the uring. If we attempt to operate on a descriptor whose
    // generation is greater than the "clean" generation, it isn't truly registered and we use
    // the FD as-is.
    //
    // When the uring wakes, we check if we are dirty and then perform the registration syscall
    // and then move the clean generation marker up.
    //
    // For unregistering, we simply increment the dirty generation marker so that we will pick it
    // up later.
    //
    // The "TODO" part is that this is almost certainly unoptimal and could be heavily optimized.
    // Would it have been better not to bother? Who can say.
    //
    // In terms of making this work, we need to start by making it easier to replace elements:
    // in our toolkit, this would take place as a pair of embedded lists tracking (1) available
    // slots and (2) dirty changes that need to be flushed. Harder is optimizing how the refresh
    // works; i'm not entirely sure how expensive various optimizable portions of the refresh
    // syscall are.
